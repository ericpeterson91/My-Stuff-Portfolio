# My Stuff Portfolio

My second project is an app to track items a user owns in the physical world. The user enters items they own in the physical world (eg. couch, desk, etc.), the cost of each item, and the purchase date. 

The app then tracks this item, and calculates a total value by summing the cost of all items entered. The user enters the purchase price in Canadian dollars, and then the app finds the sum of all items in both Canadian dollars, and American dollars. American dollars are calculated by an API located at exchangeratesapi.io.

Users can add comments to each item as they see fit. Each item has its own comment page. 

Users are able to edit and delete items whenever they want. Users are also able to clear the comment section from each item.

Users log in with their Google account using Google OAuth.

# Next Steps

Change the API fetch function so I can keep the API for free. I want to show this project on my GitHub now and into the future, and I don't want to pay for this API forever. 

Continue to style the app as my skill improves.

Continue to add functionality to the app as I get more ideas, and my skill improves.
